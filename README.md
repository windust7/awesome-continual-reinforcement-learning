This repository contains a collection of papers and codes for continual reinforcement learning.

I select papers that **attempt to solve continual reinforcement learning problems** and **deal with things that can be considered to solve continual reinforcement learning problems**(etc section which is mainly about plasticity).

I promise to continue to maintain this repository (I plan to update **at least one paper each week**, but there may be some weeks I am unable to do so) so if you know papers worth adding, please open a pull request or send a message(email) to me. Tell me where the article was published and when, and send me GitHub and ArXiv links if they are available.

I am also open to any ideas for improvements. Thank you.
